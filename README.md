# TEMIP_sensitivity

This repository contains all data, scripts and libraries to reproduce the results from the article "" by Lukas Aigner, Dieter Werthmüller and Adrian Flores Orozco (except for the QGIS map).

Function and classes needed to run the scripts are located in the library subfolder.
Please find the scripts within the Figures folder. The scripts are configured to add a relative import path to os.sys

For everythin related to the sensitivity analysis, please use the salib_tem.yml file to build the corresponding environment, while all the other scripts can be run using the empypg environment.
